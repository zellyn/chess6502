# Match & measurement log

Newest first. Engine budgets are emulated time (1.0205 MHz); opponent
controls are wall time. See docs/plan.md for the measurement protocol.

## 2026-07-18 — M5a: eval terms, dither, and the depth verdict

- Pawn structure + king shield (FT_PSTRUCT) self-play A/B: +14 +/- 57
  over 100 games at 30 emulated s/move — directionally positive,
  unresolved at this sample size (accumulation continues).
- TSCP-d3 rematch with dither: **0-18-2** (from 0-20). First draws, and
  the games are finally distinct (per-move seeded eval dither, the
  simulation of the hardware plan to seed from input timing).
- **The decisive diagnostic**: the bridge now emits depth/score into
  the PGNs — we search **depth 4** at 30 emulated s/move in the
  middlegame. The remaining gap to TSCP-d3 is depth, not sanity.
  Next lever: the open performance items (lazy legality ~15-20%,
  move-loop restructure ~10-15%, make() fusion ~5-7%, give-check
  propagation ~15-20%) — together roughly a node doubling, ~+1 ply,
  compounding with ID/TT. Then re-measure.

## 2026-07-18 — post-fix measurements

Feature gates, self-play at 30 emulated s/move, generated paired
openings (80 games each; the fourth run was cut off by a task limit):
null +0 +/- 47, killers +26 +/- 50, futility +0 +/- 49. The 43%
tree-size win compresses to small Elo in self-play at these depths;
resolving +20-30 needs 400+ games (queued).

TSCP-d3 rematch at 30 emulated s/move: **0-20**. But the game character
changed completely: no more degenerate moves — legal, coherent,
planless chess, ground down positionally (opponent evals creep +0.4 to
+5 over ~25 moves). Diagnosis for next session: (a) instrument realized
search depth per move in games; (b) the eval gap — TSCP has pawn
structure + king safety, we are PSQT-only (M5 terms may now be worth
more than search); (c) deterministic + bookless = the same losing line
repeats every White game (book/variety, M6); (d) A/B the TT aux
carryover, which was never gated.

## 2026-07-18 — M4 debugging night: the pruning stack made real

Fixed-depth tree size on the reference middlegame position (cycles to
complete the search; the honest metric after learning that budget-mode
soft-stops invalidate comparisons):

| Features | Depth 6 cycles | vs baseline |
|---|---|---|
| none | 8,575M | — |
| null move | 7,498M | −13% |
| null + killers + futility | 4,912M | −43% |

What it took to get there (full detail in
docs/reviews/2026-07-18-code-review.md):
1. Adversarial review found null move disabled by an unsigned compare
   on the beta high byte (negative betas always read as "mate zone").
2. Fixing that made trees BIGGER (+73%): single-step instrumentation
   showed the search was QS-dominated (capture chains to ply 30,
   captures in piece-list order, delta pruning documented but never
   implemented). Fixed: two-tier MVV capture passes, per-ply delta
   threshold, capture-only qs generation.
3. Still bigger with null: shallow nulls (remaining 2-3) reduce to bare
   QS sweeps that start fail-low (with the eval>=beta gate, the null
   child's stand-pat can never cut) — all cost, no value when ordering
   already cuts on the first real move. Floor raised to remaining >= 4;
   null cutoffs now also store TT lower bounds, and attempts are gated
   on static eval >= beta.

Also: TT upper-bound cutoffs missed score==alpha (fixed; the baseline
itself dropped ~40% from this), eval got w=32/w=0 taper fast paths,
futility/RFP gained mate-zone window guards, iteration 1 is now
abort-immune.

## 2026-07-18 — M3 complete: first calibration matches

Engine: ID + aux TT + UCI bridge, 30 emulated s/move (~30.6M cycles).

| Opponent | Conditions | Result |
|---|---|---|
| N.E.G. 1.1 (very weak) | st=1 wall | **2-0** (mates both colors) |
| TSCP 1.81 (~1700 CCRL) | st=2 wall (full strength) | 0-10 |
| TSCP depth-limited to 3 | st=2, depth=3 | 0-6 |

Analysis (verified, not guessed):
- Bridge vs cold-engine replay of the loss prefix: identical moves at
  every turn — no TT-carryover corruption, no bridge bug.
- The "hung pawn" moves are PeSTO working as specified: an a-file pawn
  is worth only ~47cp in the mg table (82 - 35 PSQT), so trading it for
  ~20cp of activity is what the eval orders. Verified arithmetically:
  startpos minus the white a-pawn evals -37 = -(82-35) + 10 tempo.
- The real gap is depth: measured EBF is still ~8 (depth 5 on a
  middlegame position cost 5.1B cycles; 30M budget reaches ~depth 4).
  TSCP at depth 3 + its fuller eval outplays that.
- One real bug found and fixed en route: an aborted ID iteration's
  partial "best move" (fail-hard: the first root move always raises
  alpha from -INF) was preferred over the last completed iteration's
  move; with the root TT entry evicted this returned near-arbitrary
  moves, degrading play as the game went on.

This is the recorded pre-pruning baseline. M4 (null move R=2, killers,
futility/RFP) attacks the EBF directly; the plan's model expects those
to buy 2-4 effective plies at the same budget.

Also measured this cycle:
- ID + TT vs cold fixed-depth: WAC.001 to depth 4 in 706M cycles vs
  2,473M (3.5x, including depths 1-3). Suite: 1,537M vs 3,715M.
- WAC subset: 6/7 at depth 4 (both modes).
