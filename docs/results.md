Newest first. Engine budgets are emulated time (1.0205 MHz); opponent
controls are wall time. See docs/plan.md for the measurement protocol.

## 2026-07-18 — M3 complete: first calibration matches

Engine: ID + aux TT + UCI bridge, 30 emulated s/move (~30.6M cycles).

| Opponent | Conditions | Result |
|---|---|---|
| N.E.G. 1.1 (very weak) | st=1 wall | **2-0** (mates both colors) |
| TSCP 1.81 (~1700 CCRL) | st=2 wall (full strength) | 0-10 |
| TSCP depth-limited to 3 | st=2, depth=3 | 0-6 |

Analysis (verified, not guessed):
- Bridge vs cold-engine replay of the loss prefix: identical moves at
  every turn — no TT-carryover corruption, no bridge bug.
- The "hung pawn" moves are PeSTO working as specified: an a-file pawn
  is worth only ~47cp in the mg table (82 - 35 PSQT), so trading it for
  ~20cp of activity is what the eval orders. Verified arithmetically:
  startpos minus the white a-pawn evals -37 = -(82-35) + 10 tempo.
- The real gap is depth: measured EBF is still ~8 (depth 5 on a
  middlegame position cost 5.1B cycles; 30M budget reaches ~depth 4).
  TSCP at depth 3 + its fuller eval outplays that.
- One real bug found and fixed en route: an aborted ID iteration's
  partial "best move" (fail-hard: the first root move always raises
  alpha from -INF) was preferred over the last completed iteration's
  move; with the root TT entry evicted this returned near-arbitrary
  moves, degrading play as the game went on.

This is the recorded pre-pruning baseline. M4 (null move R=2, killers,
futility/RFP) attacks the EBF directly; the plan's model expects those
to buy 2-4 effective plies at the same budget.

Also measured this cycle:
- ID + TT vs cold fixed-depth: WAC.001 to depth 4 in 706M cycles vs
  2,473M (3.5x, including depths 1-3). Suite: 1,537M vs 3,715M.
- WAC subset: 6/7 at depth 4 (both modes).
